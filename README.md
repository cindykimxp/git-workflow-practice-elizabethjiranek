[Betamore launches software engineering training program for Baltimore residents](https://technical.ly/baltimore/2021/09/23/betamore-software-training/)

### Comments

This article is about a new software engineering training program in Baltimore called Betamore. I find this particulary interesting because I'm from Baltimore, and while it's not a tech centered city, I think it's great that there are intiatives to push more education in the software engineering space.

This article highlights the features of this program – for Baltimore residents to help jumpstart their careers in software development. Successful participants of this program will receive job offers upon completion for full time positions in software development.

Founded by Baltimore native Aaron Brooks, this program will provide the opportunity for 15 individuals a path to software engineering that doesn't involve a four-year degree.
