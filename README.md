[Waymo CEO Says Tesla is Not a Competitor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2021/01/22/waymo-ceo-says-tesla-is-not-a-competitor-gives-estimated-cost-of-autonomous-vehicles/?sh=6c99c687541b)

### Comments

When we think about autonomous vehicles, we typically think about Tesla, but I've always thought that Waymo's differentiated technology, unique business model and their strong management team are key drivers to market.

I thought this article was interesting because it outlines the key differences in technology use between Waymo and its competitors. Tesla uses advanced AI and camera systems while Waymo uses LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems – similar to what topographers use.

I also find their business model particularly interesting – an Uber-like fleet of vehicles as an on-demand service. While this is not necessarily unique to Waymo, (there are other companies in the autonomous vehicle space that are approaching it in a similar way), they project the that cost-per-mile will be $0.30 while Uber and Lyft currently average at around $2-3. Also – due to Google’s presence as their parent company, they have a huge amount of capital for future marketing, research and development, etc.
